# crateful

This simple TUI streamlines sorting through music files to save or delete.

Start the app with "cgs run dev"

Then use numbers 1-9 to scrub through the song, 10% - 90% through the track.

Press backspace to delete a track, and s to save. The next track starts immediately.

As of now, this only works with my file layout (project folder in ~/dev/, and pulling new tracks from ~/Music/incoming while saving tracks in ~/Music/saved)

# Crateful - For Music Collectors, DJs, & Pirates

Let's say you've acquired a trove of new music files. Sorting through them, desciding what to save where, and what to delete, can take hours.

This app streamlines the process!

## When First Opening Crateful

You will be prompted to select the folder of music to sort. Read the instructions to navigate the file explorer (it's easy!). The first track will start playing immediately.

Next, you need to asign where to save your "keepers". Press 'a' and you'll have another file explorer menu. 

Now, while a track is playing, pressing 'a' will save that track to the folder selected. Next track starts right away (no backsies).

You can also assign folders to the 'd' and 'g' keys. So one folder for metal tracks, one for jazz, one for EDM... you get the picture.

## Scrubbing & Deleting
Use numbers 1-9 to scrub through the song, 10% - 90% through the track.

Press backspace to delete a track. The next track starts immediately. There's no undoing a deletion.
